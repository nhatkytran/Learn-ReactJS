--> Synthetic Event

--> Wrapper for Native event of Browser
--> Created by React
--> Add more attributes to event

--> const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
--> Why setState can change the value of state while we declare state with const
--> setState only changes value, not reassigns value
--> const variable --> [ < value > ] (memory)

--> Parent re-render --> All its child re-render
--> PureComponent --> shouldComponentUpdate --> check props and state --> true or false
--> Rich Objects or Arrays --> React.memo
