5. Critical Questions

--> What's React all about?

--> React does 2 things for us
+ Displays HTML
+ Changes that HTML when the user does something
--> When using React, at the end of the day, it is still HTML \
that is causing content to appear on the screen of the user's browser
--> React as being like a wrapper around HTML of sorts

--> React Components?

--> Functions that return JSX (stuff that looks like HTML) --> Tells React what to show on the screen
--> A project can have many components that work together
--> Each individual component is in charge of displaying content \
for a certain portion of the application
--> Coordinate the flow of information of all components

--> JSX?

--> The stuff that looks like HTML --> Tells React to \
+ Create a normal HTML <div></div>
+ Show another component <Component /> --> Nested Component starts with Capital letter
--> JSX element starts with lowercase --> HTML element
--> Starts with uppercase --> Component

6. More Critical Questions

--> How does a React app start up?

Step 1 --> All of your project's JS files are 'bundled' together into a single file, \
            then placed onto a server --> bundle.js or App Bundle
Step 2 --> User makes request to the server and gets an HTML file + the bundle
Step 3 --> User's browser executes your code

--> Browser executes your code

Step 1 --> Find the div with id of 'root' in the DOM
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');

Step 2 --> Tell React to take control of that element
const root = createRoot(rootElement)

Step 3 --> Tell React to get JSX from the App component, turn it into HTML, and show it in the root
root.render(<App />)

--> What is the 'useState' functions?

- 'useState' is a function that works with React's 'state' system
- State is like variable in React
- State is used to store data that changes over time
- Whenever state changes, React automatically updates content on the screen

8. Creating a React Project

npx create-react-app < name >

9. What is Create React App?

--> JSX files (index.js, App.js, reportWebVitals.js) --> Invalid JS code --> Browser doesn't know how to execute
            Create React App Dev Server
JSX files --> Babel --> Webpack --> bundle.js

--> Babel --> Tool to turn JSX into normal JS code
--> Webpack --> Tool to merge all project files into a single file

10. Showing basic content

--> Understand index.js (take a look at ./jxs/index.js)

--> The React library is a library that understands what a component is and it knows \
how to make multiple components work together to create usable application
--> The ReactDOM library that knows how to take a set of components, \
turn them into HTML, and show that on the screen of the browser

--> The React library --> The base library
--> Goes with different libraries like (ReactDOM) --> show components in different environments
