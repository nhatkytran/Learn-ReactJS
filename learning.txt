5. Critical Questions

--> What's React all about?

--> React does 2 things for us
+ Displays HTML
+ Changes that HTML when the user does something
--> When using React, at the end of the day, it is still HTML \
that is causing content to appear on the screen of the user's browser
--> React as being like a wrapper around HTML of sorts
--> React using JSX --> HTML

--> React Components?

--> Functions that return JSX (stuff that looks like HTML) --> Tells React what to show on the screen
--> A project can have many components that work together
--> Each individual component is in charge of displaying content \
for a certain portion of the application
--> Coordinate the flow of information of all components

--> JSX?

--> The stuff that looks like HTML --> Tells React to \
+ Create a normal HTML <div></div>
+ Show another component <Component /> --> Nested Component starts with Capital letter
--> JSX element starts with lowercase --> HTML element
--> Starts with uppercase --> Component
